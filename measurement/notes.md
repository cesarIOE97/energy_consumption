 - CHOOSE MEDIAN INSTEAD OF MEAN FOR DATA
 - Check the cpu usage, memory usage and CPU CYCLES (or CPU times)
 - Keep the difference in each version plot and SET to percentage (Relative results) instead of the JOULES (Absolute number)
 - Confirm the number of threads and the change of multithreading (Java application)
 - Confirm the behavior or trends with important parameters like (cpu, memory, time)
 - Nbody vs BinaryTrees
 - 


 - Scatterplot (energy vs time) (by version groups)
 - Scatterplot (energy vs memory)
 - Scatterplot (time vs memory)
